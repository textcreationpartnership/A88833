            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.6. <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t a miſt]</hi> Some render it, <hi>Or a miſt:</hi> It may be rendred, <hi>And a miſt.</hi> And ſo the negative <hi>not</hi> expreſſed in the foregoing clauſe, is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to be underſtood, thus, There was <hi>not</hi> a man to till the ground, and a miſt went up; that is, and a miſt went <hi>not</hi> up. A like phraſe ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.6. Let <hi>Reuben</hi> live and <hi>not</hi> die, and let his men be few, that is, Let <hi>not</hi> his men be few; And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. Talk no more ſo exceedingly proud, let arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy proceed out of your mouth, that is, Let <hi>not</hi> arrogancie proceed out of your mouth. So that the miſt is denied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the making of Herbs and Plants, as well as man, earth, or rain are denied to concurre; The Sun could not concurre, for as much as the Sun was not made untill the fourth day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Herbs and Plants were made the third day. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12. The fruit of this note is, that, howſover Earth, Man, Sun, Rain and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113721:5"/> Miſt may be and are nurſes and furtherers of Herbs and Plants once made, yet none of theſe, except the Earth, were uſed of God the maker of Herbs and Plants, in the making of them; And the Earth was not then uſed, as having any aptitude of it ſelf to produce Herbs and Plants into being, which had no being; For it is proved, that God made the Herbs and the Plants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were in the Earth. <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. Only it is probable, that God did take a parcell of Earth (as it may be ſaid) and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did make Herbs and Plants, which afterwards he did ſet into the Earth, as into a fit nurſery. Hence are ſo many ſeverall kind of Herbs and Flowers in one ſmall cloſure of ground. That ground cannot be preſumed to have ſo many ſeverall natures, as to effect thoſe where they were not; wherefore, it muſt needs be, that, they have and are exiſtences diſtinct from the Earth, wherein they are ſet and grow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.19. <hi>I am</hi> Eſau <hi>thy firſt born.]</hi> The word <hi>Eſau</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>made.</hi> So that it may be underſtood, as if he had ſaid, I am <hi>made</hi> thy firſt born. The which ſence acquitteth <hi>Jacob</hi> from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. For as much, as though he were not the firſt born of <hi>Iſaack</hi> by priority of birth; yet he was now made firſt born by a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contract; for, he bought the birth-right of <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe it was. And that birth-rights may be made his, whoſe deſcenſively they were not, witneſſe is <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who obtained the birth-right from <hi>Reuben</hi> his elder brother. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. And, as for the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions wherewith <hi>Jacobs</hi> life was much load to, it ſeemeth not ſafe to impute them (as ſome do) unto this ſpeech of his, as to the cauſe. For, ſo we might condemn where God hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, ne condemne, where God hath bleſſed. For, we finde <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed, but no where taxed of God in Scripture, for a lye in theſe words, nor for his manner of coming by the bleſſing; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſeemeth to ſome to be a ſinfully deceitfull way. And us for his afflictions, commiſeration and pity ſhould be ſhowed to ſuch as he was, in caſe of affliction, not cenſure. Otherwiſe we might condemn the generation of the juſt, and would not be ſo dealt withall our ſelves in our affliction.</p>
            <p>It may ſeem lawfull to take to ones ſelf in ſome caſes ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or equivocall words,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Provided, that the party to whom they be uttered, be not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113721:5"/> wronged, he nor any other preſent nor abſent. Wronged, I ſay, but I do not ſay grieved; for a perſon may be grieved, where he is not wronged.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Provided that there be a truth in the words though there be not that truth or truth in that ſence which or wherein the hearer conceiveth them.</p>
            <p>The time when this ambiguous ſpeaking, or this equivocation is lawfull, is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the hearer hath gone about either wrongfully to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us of ſome due of ours, as in the preſent caſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> where his father went about to eſtabliſh the bleſſing upon the profane ſonne, for his veniſons ſake, contrary to the oracle of God, who had foretold the bleſſing to be the younger ſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or when he endeavoureth to bring ſome undeſerved evill upon us, as in the Midwives of <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would have ſlain, if they had not put him of with ambiguity of words. Or, like unto that of <hi>Rahab,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Jericho</hi> would have preſented, if he had known that ſhe had hid the ſpies. Of whom more in the due place.</p>

               <hi>Gen.</hi> 33.8. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> eſt mihi multum, <hi>I have much,</hi> not I have enough. <hi>Eſau</hi> hankered after the gift, though complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally he ſeemed to refuſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> is hearty <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>eſt mihi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</hi> I have all. Or <hi>I have enough.</hi> Carnall worldlings long and linger after gain, when they ſeem mannerly to refuſe, or never have enough; whereas ſpirituall godly perſons are fully content with their condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.13. And they ſaid, <hi>Becauſe he had defiled</hi> Dinah <hi>their ſiſter;</hi> what they ſaid, being the principall clauſe whereon this conjunctive clauſe dependeth, is not expreſſed but underſtood by a figure called Apoſiopeſis.</p>
            <p>For, 1. Shall they which intend ſlaughter to <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> tell <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> to their face, that they intend to kill them? No, that is the way to forearme <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor,</hi> and to make them ſtand upon their guard. <hi>Praemonitus, praemunitus.</hi> Forewarned, forearmed. <hi>In vaine is the not ſpred in the ſight of any bird. And if the houſholder did know beforehand at what houre the theif</hi> (and ſpecially the murtherer) <hi>would come, he would have watched, and not ſuffered his houſe to be broken through,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113721:6"/> himſelf to be ſlain; wherefore, <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons which intended to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> to the death, muſt and did in policie conceal their intent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As they did conceal their murtherous intent againſt <hi>Shechens, Hamor,</hi> and againſt their people, ſo they muſt in policie pretend ſome plauſible thing to <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor,</hi> whereby <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Hamor</hi> might be the more ſecure, and what was more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible then the marriage, which <hi>Shechem</hi> ſo much deſired? Hence therefore its more then probable, that they would be thought to intimate the marriage, when they intend ſlaughter. As if they ſhould have ſaid, <hi>Foraſmuch as</hi> Shechem <hi>had defiled</hi> Dinah <hi>our ſiſter,</hi> and the vitiation done, cannot be undone, though we be loth to expreſſe ſo much, becauſe of the greif and ſhame which is upon us for the deflouring of our ſiſter, yet you may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that ſhe ſhall be granted unto you for a wife. He which humbleth a Virgin, ſhall marry her by the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of reaſon. But, indeed our intent is to come upon you unawares and ſlay you, although we will not tell you ſo, nor would that you ſhould ſo ſuſpect; falſe meanings uſe to intimate by nods and ſignes that which they intend not; but he which meaneth truly, ſpeaketh out plainly, without reſervation. Glorious is the truth which ſo dazleth the eyes of a falſe meaner, that yet he dare not face it; elſe, why did not <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſons plainly expreſſe that <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem</hi> ſhould have their ſiſter? It would have been but a lye; and what can make thoſe be afraid of telling a lye, which were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of murthering a City full of people, but the glory of the truth? Violence in affection in <hi>Hamor</hi> to <hi>Dinah</hi> ſwalloweth an inſufficient anſwer without examination; no marvell though it be ſaid that love is blind, elſe <hi>Hamor</hi> and <hi>Shechem</hi> might have ſeen a manifeſt inſufficiencie in this Anſwer.</p>

            <p>It may ſeem, that this was no leſſe then an adviſed ſcorning of the true God; as if they ſhould have ſaid, The God which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to have brought us out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> doth not ſhew any more God-head then this calf; he neither appeareth to our eye, nor ſpeaketh to our ear; and as for this <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was choſen by us, and appointed by him, to be our ſpokeſman, we know not what is become of him. When God appeared to their eye in lightnings, and ſpake to their ear in thunders, &amp;c. they ſeemed to fear, ſo as that they deſired they might never hear that voice of God, nor ſee that viſion any more, for if they did, they ſhould dye; upon which occaſion they deſired that <hi>Moſes</hi> might mediate betwixt God and them, and they would obey, as well as if God himſelf had appeared and ſpoken; God approveth of their motion, and furniſheth <hi>Moſes</hi> with Commandements and Ordinances for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> But before <hi>Moſes</hi> was come down from the Mount, they had begun thus to ſleight both God and <hi>Moſes,</hi> as to prefer a Calf before either of them.

            <p>In like manner, the viſitation of the bloud of <hi>Jezrecl</hi> upon the houſe of <hi>Jehu, Hoſea,</hi> 1.4. ſeemeth to teach that <hi>Jehu</hi> was not authorized of God, to out off the houſe of <hi>Ahab;</hi> but only fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of God, that he ſhould cut off the houſe of <hi>Ahab.</hi> It will not follow, that becauſe <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid, he ſaith that God laid that burden upon him; therefore it was a burden, or a command laid upon him by God. <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> conſidering that the Scriptures had foretold the death of the Meſſiah, conceiveth himſelf a worth, worker with God, when he helpeth to bring that death to paſſe, by delivering his Maſter Chriſt, into the hand of his Crucifiers; or at leſt a leſſer ſinner.

Of ſomething doing, ſomething commeth; Only put a man out of ſervice, and then he becometh a vagabond. As it is ſaid, <hi>be of good comfort, he calleth thee;</hi> So it may be ſaid, be of good comfort, he commandeth thee. Thus the Law is mingled with Goſpel: Wherefore they which caſt off the Law, caſt off their comfort. But this <hi>Thou,</hi> is firſt meant every man of Iſrael: Secondly, and in this place, Chriſt tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to himſelf; for the meaning is, as if Chriſt had ſaid, I muſt not tempt the Lord my God, whom I ſhould indeed ſinfully tempt, if I ſhould caſt my ſelf down, when by ordinary ſteps or ſtaires I may ſafely deſcend.</p>
                  <p>Where note, that what once of old God delivered to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in commandement, that Chriſt taketh as commanded to himſelf; Thus Chriſt himſelf was not exempted from the Law, but was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113721:10"/> under the Law. What kind of men then do they make themſelves in our dayes, who tell us that they are not under the Law by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſtianity? taking the word Law for the morall Law in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> not through too much learning; where it is meant of naturall deſcent from <hi>Abraham,</hi> as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.21. Tell me ye that will be under the Law; had not <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> two ſons? And this ſalvation by vertue of <hi>Abrahams</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent was the great expectation of the carnall Jewes, which <hi>Paul</hi> every where laboureth to diſprove; not the leaſt intending in that place the morall Law: for, of the morall Law he ſaith elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, that he himſelf is under the Law to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Whether is it eaſier to ſay, thy ſinnes be forgiven thee, or to ſay, ariſe and walk?]</hi> By the word, <hi>ſay,</hi> is meant ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall ſaying, which is doing; For, to ſay <hi>thy ſinnes are forgiven,</hi> or to ſay, <hi>take up thy bed,</hi> are both eaſie, if we mean a meer ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the meaning is, Whether is it eaſier to forgive ſins, or to cauſe a lame man to take up his bed and walk? as if he ſhould ſay, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is as eaſie to declare, as to make a palſied man to take up his bed and walk. But this latter I have done, which cannot be done without a divine power; <hi>Ergo,</hi> I may do the leſſer, or eaſier, if either be leſſer or eaſier then the other.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113721:11"/> unto you; but I am ſure you goe away with my mony, or mony worth; and it's idleneſſe which ſetteth you upon this work: he had had a fit opportunity ſo to upbraid them. But if no man could ſay this or the like, then the Apoſtles had thorowly cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. Whence it ſeemeth to follow ſeaſonably, that hee which is not guilty of covetouſneſſe in diſpenſation of the Goſpel, is not uſually overtaken with other groſſe evils. But thus more cleerly; that,</p>
                  <p>Profeſſors of religion ought to carry themſelves ſo blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, that they may put themſelves upon triall before all the world, as concerning any juſt reproach: for this ſhaking off the duſt was to be done in the ſtreets of the City; ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>Get yee out into the ſtreets of the City,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Shake off the duſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.10.</p>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.38, 39. <hi>Three dayes and three nights.]</hi> That is, <hi>but</hi> three dayes and three nights at the moſt, <hi>reſtrictivè;</hi> not that he ſhall be there three dayes and three nights <hi>extenſivè.</hi> We ſold the land <hi>for ſo much;</hi> that is, <hi>but for ſo much, Acts</hi> 5.8. The third day is prefixed as the laſt day wherein he ſhall be held of death in all places where it is foretold of his reſurrection; <hi>The third day I ſhall riſe again, and goe before you into Galilee:</hi> and expreſly he diminiſheth the time, ſaying, <hi>Yet a little while, and yee ſhall ſee mee, and a little while and yee ſhall not ſee mee:</hi> So that it was but a little while wherein they ſhould not ſee him. And in three dayes he would raiſe again the temple of his body, implying the diminution of the time, not the extenſion of the time, as if hee muſt needs be three dayes in raiſing of it. No, he which ſaith, I will finiſh ſuch or ſuch a work in three dayes, doth performe his promiſe, if he performe it within the ſecond day, though he never come to the third day. So that the Jewes, who
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113721:11"/> object our New Teſtament to be contradictorious to it ſelfe, from this very text, are by this expoſition anſwered. See the places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.61. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.40, 63. The high Prieſts thought it was ſufficient to make ſure the ſepulchre till the third day, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.64. and that if within that time hee did not riſe, his word was falſified; although in <hi>Mark</hi> 8.31. hee had ſaid, that he muſt <hi>riſe again after three dayes;</hi> that is, at leaſt after three dayes. And if this ſenſe may not be admitted, for my owne part, I do not ſee what ſufficient anſwer the Jewes objecting are likely to be convinced withall. That Synecdochicall taking of three dayes and three nights for part of three dayes and three nights, is good and ſatisfactory to me alſo, foraſmuch as Chriſt reviving probably with the firſt moment of the third day, yet may be ſaid to be in the ſepulchre ſome part of the third day.</p>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Herod was exceeding ſorry.] Herod</hi> ſeemed to be ſorry, but was not ſorry; the holy Ghoſt ironically humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, as he did Sathan, when he laid the fault upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, becauſe Sathan would not be ſeen in the buſineſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. That <hi>Herod</hi> was not ſorry indeed, appeareth, in as much as hee had ſought long before to ſlay <hi>John,</hi> but feared the people. But that hee ſhould feign a ſorrow, ſtood very probably with his fear of the people: And that he ſhould plot the death of <hi>John</hi> with the damoſell and her mother, and ſhould make this feaſt to bring it about, ſtood proportionably with his hatred. Let this warn us, in the reading of this and other Scriptures, that we doe not alwayes take that for ſerious, which ſeemeth to be ſerious; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in theſe other paſſages about <hi>Herod,</hi> where he is ſaid to hear <hi>the word gladly, and</hi> to do <hi>many things</hi> after him: for if theſe had been ſerious, how did he ſeek to ſlay him? and how came it to paſſe that in a choice opportunity hee did indeed ſlay him?

So that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man which confeſſeth Chriſt with like uprightneſſe as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did, may truely be called <hi>Peter,</hi> as well as <hi>Simon</hi> was.

                  <p>Principles in perſons obtain in Scripture the appellation of perſons: <hi>Simons</hi> principle whereby hee confeſſed Chriſt to be the Son of God, is by Chriſt called <hi>Peter;</hi> the principle where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he willed Chriſt to favour himſelfe, is by Chriſt called <hi>Satan:</hi> Hence cometh that note, that there be two men in a man; a good man, which out of the good treaſure of his heart ſpeaketh good things, and an evill man which &amp;c. that is, <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the new man and the old.</p>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. <hi>I am the God of Abraham, of Iſaac, and of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi> &amp;c.] How doth this prove the Reſurrection? Thus: <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living:</hi> therefore <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> are ſtill alive in their better part, though they be dead in their bodies; and their bodies too in a ſenſe, though dead as we ſay, <hi>quoad nos,</hi> yet live in him, and unto him, inaſmuch as hee is <hi>the reſurrection and the life, Joh.</hi> 14.19. for if he live, they ſhall live alſo; its Chriſts doctrine to his Diſciples. A thing may be ſaid to live and have a being in its cauſe, when in it ſelfe it hath not yet a being: So <hi>Levi</hi> is ſaid to be, and to pay tythes in the loynes of <hi>Abraham</hi> before hee had a being. God calleth things which are not, as if they were: <hi>Hee that beleeveth in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>though hee were dead, yet ſhall hee live, John</hi> 11.25. Now, if <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> be yet alive when they are dead; then <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> may well be raiſed from the dead: But they are alive when they are dead: <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ſhall be raiſed from the dead. You Sadduces beleeve neither Angel, nor ſpirit to be; no marvell though you beleeve no reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: If you did beleeve angels and ſpirits to be, you would not doubt the reſurrection of the body. For this cauſe may it be, that Chriſt doth prove <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to live in their
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113721:12"/> ſoules or ſpirits, when their bodies are dead. It is his wonted and laudable manner to kill two errours at one blow. Thus Chriſt doth often reach over and beyond the queſtion propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to ſome further thing more profitable, whence his anſwer is more unexpected; but being well obſerved, doth reſolve both. The thing which Chriſt in this Text doth expreſly teach, is, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and the reſt were now alive, though dead in body. That <hi>Abraham</hi> and the other two ſhould be raiſed, hee doth but ſecretly or tacitely imply, by way of conſequence, from this more expreſſe aſſertion of his. <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf did but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, did but intimate; ſo Chriſt doth moſt excellently bring in <hi>Moſes,</hi> as it were, foretelling the Sadduceall and Epicureall denying of ſpirits to be negation of the reſurrection, and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> condemning of both.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26. <hi>This is my body,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, my body ſhall be a meer body, ſouleleſſe, bloudleſſe; and my bloud ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from my body before I eat with you again; as ſurely as this bread is bread, and as this wine is wine. I call things that are not, as if they were: when I ſay, the bread is my body, it is for this reaſon, viz. to awake your dull ſenſes, who doe not take notice of my future crucifixion, though I have foretold you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; for, wonders of words uſe to awake the auditor, aſwell as wonders of deeds do provoke the ſpectator.</p>
                  <p>It is meet you ſhould take notice, for theſe reaſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when that crucifixion is come to paſſe, you <hi>may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that I am hee:</hi> 1. Within your ſelves: 2. Declare it unto others. You will doubt when you ſee mee crucified by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate between two theeves, and a murtherers life deſired ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then mine; I ſay, you will doubt that I am not the man I went for, the Meſſiah, the Son of God, which I profeſſed to be: And ſo the Diſciples did doubt, ſaying, <hi>Wee had thought it had been this man which ſhould have redeemed Iſrael;</hi> implying, that now they doubted whether it was hee or no. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote I give you before-hand, to preſerve your faith from fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, though not from ſome fainting; for if I can foretell my death, with all the circumſtances thereof, then I am a God, though I die like a man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt be witneſſes of mee in Jeruſalem, and through
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113721:13"/> the world, that I am the Meſſiah, the Son of God, and Saviour of the world. Fit witneſſes you cannot be, except you take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that I foretell my death, with all the circumſtances thereof: but if you doe take notice, that I foretell my death with all the circumſtances thereof, then are yee the fitter witneſſes of mee: For howſoever every man may and muſt dye like a man, and I like an evill man; yet no man can foretell his death, with all the circumſtances thereof but a God. And by my breaking bread with you in like ſort after my reſurrection you ſhall know that I am riſen, and that it is no ghoſt in my likeneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But why doſt thou uſe bread and wine in the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thy death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe bread and wine are viſible, tangible, mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: you have forgot what you heard, you will ſurely remember what you ſee, touch, taſte, eat and drink.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And ſecondly, becauſe every god, true or falſe, hath his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles where his diſciples eat and drink to his honour, and for his memoriall; therefore doe yee thus eat and drink in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of mee, after I am riſen again and aſcended, untill I ſhall return again to judgement and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But on what faſhion wouldſt thou that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy death untill thou come, in thus doing? Or, how doth this bread and wine ſhew forth thy death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thus: Hee which by bread and wine foretold his death, with all the circumſtances thereof, howſoever hee was put to death like a man, and like an evill man; yet he was God: But Jeſus did by bread and wine foretell his death, with all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof, when no enemy touched him, nor appeared againſt him: <hi>Ergo</hi> Jeſus is God.</p>
                  <p>And if Chriſt, who was God, ſuffered death;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then doe not you wonder though you ſuffer at the hands of Magiſtrates: evill ones would crucifie God himſelf if they had him in the likeneſſe of a man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Chriſt God-man thus ſuffered, be you patient in ſuffering, and look for ſuffering.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Chriſt thus ſuffered, who was able to foretell his death, and who roſe again, then ſhall ye alſo be raiſed again after your death.</p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:113721:13"/>
                  <p>Thus the bread and wine is neither his body nor bloud, as the Papiſts ſay: neither yet any otherwiſe a ſigne of his body and bloud, then his commentary upon them made them to be ſignes, and that is not of their own nature: for the bread doth not hold ſo neer a reſemblance or ſimilitude with his body, as one body doth with another, or as one bread with ſome other bread, or as <hi>Ceſars</hi> image with <hi>Ceſar</hi> himſelfe, or as a lively picture of that thing or perſon whereof it is a picture; or as that was the Houſe of the Lord, and the Altar of burnt-offering for Iſrael, which <hi>David</hi> ſaid was ſo, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.1. The rain-bow in its owne nature is not a ſigne of non-drowning the world; for wee might long ſee the rainbow, before we could read that in the face of it, that God will not drown the world: for there were rainbowes before the floud as well as after. How then came the rainbow to be a ſign after the floud of non-drowning the world, more then before? Even becauſe God called and made the rainbow a ſigne of non-drowning after, and not before: for otherwiſe the rainbow had as much inherent ſignification of non-drowning before the floud as after. So bread and wine did as much reſemble Chriſts body and bloud before that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his, and Inſtitution, as after; and perhaps neither before nor after ſo neerly, as that any man would have ſaid, This is ſo like to the body and bloud of Chriſt, as that the one is like the other at all. Then it is the word and inſtitution of Chriſt onely which maketh the bread and wine to be ſignes of his body or bloud. And how ſignes of his body and bloud? They are rather tokens of commemoration, then ſignes. What is to be commemorated? That he was God as well as man whoſe body and bloud this is ſaid to be. Why? how will that follow from this bread and wine thus uſed in commemoration, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this inſtitution, that he was God, whoſe body and bloud is commemorated hereby? Thus: He which could foretell his death, with all the circumſtances thereof, when yet hee ſate eating, drinking, and inſtructing his diſciples, where no hand appeared againſt him, hee muſt needs be God, howſoever he ſuffer and die as man, even as an evill man: But ſuch was Chriſt, this did he foretell, inſtitute to be commemorated to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall untill he ſhall return: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The commemoration which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113721:14"/> is done by bread and wine, to that end inſtituted of Chriſt, doth rightly commemorate his godhead.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It implyeth, that the commemorators are in the ſame dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he was in. That</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though they be, yet they have no cauſe to be afraid, nor aſhamed: for their enemies did, and would again crucifie God, if they could reach him in the likeneſſe of man, as they did Chriſt, who was God. No marvell therefore if they crucifie us.</p>
                  <p>Note here alſo, That as his prophecie of his death did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare him to be God, ſo alſo his eating and drinking did imply the truth of his humanity; and that he was not a Ghoſt in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a man. To that end the Apoſtle argueth, wee ate and drank with him after he roſe from the dead. That hee did eat and drink with them that bread and wine, the word <hi>[this]</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth. Beſides, that he would drink it no more till he drank it new with them in his Fathers kingdome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Till I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome.]</hi> That is, till I be riſen from the dead. For then the Church of the New Teſtament took its full ſtate, which is ſaid to be that kingdome which was at hand. And at Emmaus in Galilee hee brake bread with them the firſt night: Breaking of bread is Synecdochically put for the whole Supper; mention of wine needed not to be repeated; its preſumed he would and did drink it with them, ſith he promiſed to drink it with them. <gap reason="foreign">

And by this drinking it new with them, or by breaking bread, which Synecdochically is all one, they did know him to be the ſame riſen which was crucified, and not a ghoſt in his likeneſſe.</p>

The High Prieſt ſpake this, and in ſo ſpeaking is ſaid to prophecy; but, he did not prophecy purpoſely or wittingly, that Chriſt ſhould die for the people; that is, for the eternall ſalvation of the people: for, then he ſhould teach and beleeve Chriſt to be the appointed Meſſiah for the ſalvation of mankind. But the meaning is, that, his words abſtracted from his intent, were in their own nature a prophecy, in which words God indeed might have an hand to verifie them, as if they had by him been purpoſely prophecied. And to ſpeak as the thing is, I take it, that the word prophecie is imputed to him ironically. It is not too much lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which maketh ſome men deny any ironies to be in Scripture; Some ironies are of that gravity, that it is not unſutable to the holineſſe of God himſelf to uſe them.</p>

                     <hi>Caution.</hi> And if any Saint or ſufferer for Chriſt ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go death for Chriſt with leſſe agony, or with more alacrity then appeared in Chriſt; it doth but argue that they are more aſſiſted now when Chriſt is aſcended, which is the reaſon there rendred of thoſe greater works; <hi>For I go to the Father,</hi> to teach that Chriſt can ordinarily beſtead his ſervants more &amp; better after his reſurrection and aſcenſion then before. This is no praiſe nor pride to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted; for what doth he performe or ſuffer, but whereunto he is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113721:18"/> aſſiſted? and if he be aſſiſted, why ſhould he boaſt, As if he were not aſſiſted? And that Chriſt could and did convey the ſpirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in a greater meaſure after his aſcenſion, then before, is plaine, where it is ſaid, that the ſpirit was not yet given unto any of them, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glorified. Perhaps the reaſon may be, becauſe the ſpirits of men were more capable and rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions after the aſcenſion of Chriſt then before. The very do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt hath that faculty in it to dilate and unlarge the minds of men.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of the point of this place is, I take it, to check ſuch as will ſay, Am I like to do and ſuffer as Chriſt did? and are you like to do at as Chriſt did and ſuffered? Yea, why not, within the compaſſe of that God calleth me to? ſeeing I do it not by my own power, but by Chriſt, and by the ſpirit of God, and by God himſelf, who aſſiſteth me? Of my ſelf I can do nothing, not live, move, or have a being, nor think a good thought: <hi>But I am able to do all things, through Chriſt which aſſiſteth me.</hi>

From the word <hi>[elſe]</hi> it followeth, That the children of beleeving Corinthians were not baptized though the Father was a beleever: for if they had been baptized, <hi>Paul</hi> would not have paralleld them with the unclean wife; for bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons are viſible Chriſtians: but viſible Chriſtians are not viſibly unclean: <hi>Ergo,</hi> viſibly unclean are not viſible Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, viſibly Chriſtened, or viſibly baptized. And if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Corinthians were baptized, why doth the Apoſtle impute unto them the ſame uncleanneſſe as to the unbeleeving wife? And whereas he pronounceth them holy, it is for this end, to prove that the unbeleeving wife is holy to her beleeving husband; an argument taken <hi>à paribus:</hi> But if the children be ſome other way holy or baptized then the unbeleeving wife, (that is, of the parent to be retained) the proportion of the Apoſtles argument between the unbeleeving wife, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the beleeving father is improportionable, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently unvaluable to the purpoſe whereto he produceth it.

So, the Apoſtle, which ſaith, if the wife be unclean, then the children are unclean; doth lie not as much as profeſſe, the like uncleanneſſe to be in the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which is in the wife, if not more? Now in that wife there was no uncleanneſſe, but of unchriſtianity: <hi>Ergo,</hi> in the children,

True it is, that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote theſe four verſes, and that by the dictate of the Spirit of God. But it is not true, that hee wrote them as his own judgement, approving them, or as the Spirits doctrine. How then did he write them? He did record them to make way for confutation of their drift, as the words or plea which the Corinthians had ſaid or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten unto him, wherein they do ſinfully endeavour to prove it lawfull for them to go into the idols temple, and there to eat meat ſacrificed to the idoll. That theſe words and verſes were theirs, and to this unwholſome end of theirs, I thus collect:</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> anſwereth theſe words contained in theſe four whole verſes, reproving and confuting the inſufficiency of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe verſes implyed, along from the beginning of the ninth verſe unto the end of the tenth Chapter: the which being obſerved, helpeth more then a little to the righter underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ninth Chapter by the way. Now, if <hi>Paul</hi> reprove theſe words, or the ſcope whereto they tend; then it is clear, that he is not the authour of them, howſoever he be the recorder thereof.</p>
                  <p>That he doth reprove and diſprove theſe words through theſe four whole verſes, all and ſome of them as invalid unto

                  <p>For inſtance: the word <hi>[know,] We know that an idoll is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world: Howbeit, there is not in all men this knowledge.</hi> This word <hi>[know]</hi> the Apoſtle ſtriketh at, when he ſaith in the firſt verſe, <hi>Wee know that wee all have knowledge</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, You not onely know, (ſuch knowledge as it is) but you are proud of your knowledge; and yet you know nothing as you ought to know: for if your knowledge were ſuch as it ought to be, you would not deſtroy your unknowing heathen neighbour by your example, as you do when you ſit at the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the idols temple. You know that an idoll is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one, and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and you ſay, that there is not in all men this knowledge: for ſome, you ſay, make conſcience of the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll, and do eat to the honour of the idoll, ſuppoſing the idoll to be ſome deity, and able to help them; and ſo they being weak, that is, being ignorant, are defiled in their very mind and conſcience; yea, and likely to be deſtroyed too, becauſe they put their truſt in an idoll which cannot ſave them. And you ſay, It is ſin to them thus to eat before the idoll; but you ſay. that you are free from ſin though you do the ſame thing: Why? Becauſe you do not eat as to the honour of an idoll: but you eat as the meat is Gods creature; and ſit in that temple, not as it is dedicated to the honour of an idoll, but as it ſtands upon Gods ground, alledging for that purpoſe a place in the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>The earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof, Pſal.</hi> 24.1. But if the earth be the Lords, Have you not places enow upon Gods ground to go upon, unleſſe you go into the idols temple? And if all the fulneſſe of the earth be the Lords, Will no meat and drink in the whole world ſuffice you to eat and drink, except that meat which is dedicated to an idoll? Thus doth the Apoſtle anſwer in the tenth Chapter, repeating twice that place in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. by which repetition a

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113721:22"/> Church (females excepted) may prophecie, provided they can and doe ſo prophecie, that all may learn by them, and all may be comforted; otherwiſe not. Now whether learning as well as godlineſſe be neceſſary or not neceſſary to ſuch prophecy, as whereby all may learn, and all may be comforted, I leave to be further inquired of the godly learned. Loth I am to deny any ſaint of God his priviledge which Chriſt hath purchaſed for him; I have ſins enow, though I make not my ſelfe guilty of that But withall, as I would not quench the ſpirit, or deſpiſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the meaneſt who propheſieth according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faith, and of grace, or gift by him received, within the limits of learning and comfort by the Apoſtle here ſet: ſo do I judge that doctrine neither holy, humble, comfortable, nor true, but a quencher of the ſpirit, a deſpiſer of propheſying, which either excludeth learning from prophecie, or doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre non-learning before learning in prophecie; which doctrine hath been publiſhed, printed, and maintained by ſome who knew not what learning was, in this wanton age of ours, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their owne aſſertion, That a non-ſcholar is to be choſen Paſtour in the Church of Chriſt, rather then a Scholar, though the Scholar be equally gifted, graced, ſpirited in all other things: Witneſſe a ſecond aſſertion of the ſame authour, That learning (which he all the way expreſſeth to be Arts and Tongues) is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from a ſpirituall uſe. He delivereth, I ſay, <hi>That learning is accurſed from a ſpirituall uſe;</hi> with many more witneſſes then two or three, which are ſufficient to prove the author and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of thoſe doctrines ſo far forth to have blaſphemed againſt the Scriptures: foraſmuch as no one ſentence of Scripture was written without the art of Grammar, neither poſſibly could; unleſſe the Reader ſhould be left void of the letter, and of the ſenſe. But of theſe it may be ſaid in a ſenſe, <hi>Father, forgive them, they know not what they doe: Father, forgive them, they know not what they</hi> ſay. For ſome of them being demanded, whether the holy Ghoſt in the conſtitution of Scripture do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the congruity of the Adjective with his Subſtantive; that is, whether the Adjective doth uſe to agree with his Subſtantive in the conſtitution of Scripture: they have anſwered, as ſome did about the holy Ghoſt, That they do not know any Adjective
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113721:23"/> or Subſtantive to be in the Scripture at all. And what was the anſwer of theſe ſome, we are ſure might be the anſwer of all the reſt which ſo teach, for any learning which they are guilty of. But, in the mean time, let the remnant of them <hi>learn not to blaſpheme: They have ſpoken evill of the things which they know not;</hi> one mark (amongſt many more) of the unlearned falſe teachers of theſe later dayes, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. compared with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. the very verſe by this undertaker wreſted againſt learning, as aforeſaid. So juſtly hath his arrow (being ſhot up againſt learning) returned upon his own head. If he and his Executors had had as much ambition unto learned propheſying, as they had ambition to propheſying ſuch as it was; they had been as godly, as now they were ungodly; and they had been as true, as now they were lying: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly,</hi> I ſay; for, Can there be greater ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then to put down learned propheſying by a law, or by a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the name of the Lord? and to advance ignorance of the Originall Tongues and Arts, which make for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures: as if that ignorance of Hebrew, Greek, Grammaticall, and other learning were the only learning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Scriptures can be underſtood? I am not afraid to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this doctrine which is againſt learning aforeſaid, to be a mocker, proud, envious, hypocriticall, and one of the greateſt lies which ever was told in the name of the Lord ſince the world began. What could the Divell do (if he were in the likeneſſe of a man) more worthy of himſelfe, then to deſtroy learning from godlineſſe, literature from the holy Scriptures, and to ſet up non-learning, and put down learning, as the onely divine learning, for his own bellies ſake? No marvell though the whole Law of God at a clap fared no better at the ſame hands: for to caſhiere the Law, Learning, and Sabbath, ſute very propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably together. The holy Ghoſt provideth againſt ſuch in theſe words (foreſeeing their forwardneſſe to propheſie), <hi>Ye may all propheſie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>one by one;</hi> provided, <hi>that all may learn</hi> by you, <hi>and all be comforted:</hi> otherwiſe not.</p>

Surely there ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to be a reſurrection of the dead, or theſe ſaid voluntary Martyrs, which choſe death rather then deliverance, are greatly deceived. For, the reaſon why they give themſelves to be drench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed overhead and ears, not in water only, but in afflictions, and in death; is, becauſe they expect a better reſurrection. And they do it one after another; that is, though they ſee others of their brethren martyred before their eyes, yet they are not the leſſe, but the more incenſed to maintain that cauſe, for which they ſhall be likewiſe dealt with all. This voluntary death might be expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a ſinfull caſting away of their own lives, if there be not a reſurrection.

Thus to learn Chriſt, <hi>Paul</hi> found the moſt hard peece of learning of all other, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the moſt excellent peece of learning; and ſo neceſſary that he accounted all other learning of tongues and Arts, of Scriptures and notion of Chriſt himſelf to be as nothing in compariſon of this imitation and conformity to Chriſt in his doings, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his ſufferings; Lo here, what learning is the hardeſt to come by, and the moſt excellent being obtained, and ſo neceſſary, that whoſoever knoweth Chriſt himſelf according to notion, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113721:26"/> can preach Chriſt according to all the myſtery of Chriſtianity, yet is but as a ſounding braſſe and tinkling Cymball, without this unfeined, faithfull, reall doing and ſuffering as Chriſt did and ſuffered. He who hath learned to ſuffer as Chriſt ſuffered, even to the loſſe of life and all, is the higheſt ſcholar in the world, and he who is loweſt in the Schoole or Kingdome of Chriſt, muſt be no leſſe learned; For, ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>He that forſaketh not all, even to his owne life, cannot be my Diſciple.</hi> Men may conceive amiſſe, and teach amiſſe the Doctrine of Chriſt, for baſe ends, as for vaine glory, for gaine; but in imitating of Chriſt, in doing and ſuffering, hath no ſnare in it to catch my brother by deceit or ſiniſter reſpect; No man lightly can be powerfull in his whole converſation, a doer and ſufferer in jeſt. This did <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſpake more tongues, and had more learning then all other Apoſtles; remember therefore, that once a Scholar brought up, was as great a ſufferer as any of the unſcholared tribe. Let me ſee any of the unlearned tribe, (which ſay, that there was never any good yet which were learned) I ſay let me ſee any of them or theirs which have ſuffered with like patience as his learned Apoſtle did? Ne, did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſuffer many abuſes from the unlearned <hi>Corinthians,</hi> though Chriſtians of his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, with little thanks from them for his labour; witneſſe, that though he both ſpent, and was ready to be ſpent for them; yet the more he loved them, the leſſe be was beloved of them. It was not too much learning made them ſo chubbed and boggiſh to their moſt generous and noble Apoſtle. They made him work with his hands day and night to the maintenance of himſelfe and thoſe which were with him; yea, and to ſpend upon them, and be ſpent for them, as before is ſaid, with ſo much leſſe love, by how much more love he ſhowed unto them. This peece of obedience the unlearned Antiliterarians of our dayes can practice without going to Schoole to learn it.</p>
